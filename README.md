# Trumpocalypse-VR-for-Cardboard

I created a Virtual Reality Game for Google Cardboard using Unity3D. The Trumpocalypse game is inspired by the Asteroids game, and 
the objective is to destroy all the Trumps before they get to the White House.

The White House in the center of the space field has 4 walls that explode when a Trump head comes into contact with it. Use the tap button
on your google cardboard to shoot a projectile and they will destroy. 

The UI for the scoring needs work, as they are set to display the #of Trumps heads destroyed (out of 10) and the other score displays
the percentage of dignity left for the White House and its symbol for America. Each wall destroyed decreases our dignity by 25%. When all 
4 walls have been destroyed, America loses! When all the Trump heads have been destroyed before the White House is, You save hope for America!

Enjoy! I'll be making improvements on the scoring display (UI) and closing out the game with proper celebrations,etc asap!
